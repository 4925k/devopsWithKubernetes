# extract pod definition
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > pod-definition.yaml

# edit running pod
kubectl edit pod <pod-name>

kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] -o <output_format>

Here are some of the commonly used formats:

-o jsonOutput a JSON formatted API object.

-o namePrint only the resource name and nothing else.

-o wideOutput in the plain-text format with any additional information.

-o yamlOutput a YAML formatted API object.


--dry-run: By default, as soon as the command is run, the resource will be created. If you simply want to test your command, use the --dry-run=client option. This will not create the resource. Instead, tell you whether the resource can be created and if your command is right.

-o yaml: This will output the resource definition in YAML format on the screen.



Use the above two in combination along with Linux output redirection to generate a resource definition file quickly, that you can then modify and create resources as required, instead of creating the files from scratch.



kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-pod.yaml
